# Electic-Lock
Input:
The input consists of two lines of text. The first line is the message (string terminated
with '\n') and the second line is the passcode, which is a single word with letter only.
The maximum size of passcode is 10. You may assume the input of message and
passcode is always valid (passcode that cannot be decrypted is also a valid input).
Output:
The program should output the unlock order, line by line. Print "acw" for
anticlockwise and "cw" for clockwise, followed by a colon (':') and the number of steps
the knob should be turned.
